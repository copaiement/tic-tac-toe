# Tic Tac Toe

## About
This is a JS game that plays Tic Tac Toe. Players can be either bots or humans.

## Goals
* Create working Tic Tac Toe game
* Use modules and factories to run the game
* Minimize use of global variables
* OPTIONAL: Add AI players

## Thoughts
Another fun project. This one took me longer than expected as I was not used to using modules and factories for things. I also struggled for too long to get the AI working properly, even though the current AI only plays random moves. Maybe I will have to return later to code in some AI difficulty and make it make more conscious moves.
